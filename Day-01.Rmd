## Submarines Problem

### Part 1

How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?

```{r}

library(here)

input_file <- here("data/day-1-sonar.txt")
raw_sonar <- as.numeric(readLines(input_file))

delta_depth <- c(NA, diff(raw_sonar))

sum(delta_depth > 0, na.rm = TRUE)

```

### Part 2

Consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. How many sums are larger than the previous sum?

```{r}

window_sonar <- raw_sonar[1:(length(raw_sonar)-2)] + raw_sonar[2:(length(raw_sonar)-1)] + raw_sonar[3:(length(raw_sonar))]

delta_window_sonar <- c(NA, diff(window_sonar))

sum(delta_window_sonar > 0, na.rm = TRUE)


```
